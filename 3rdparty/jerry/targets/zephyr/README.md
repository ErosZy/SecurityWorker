### About

This folder contains files to integrate JerryScript with Zephyr RTOS to
run on a number of supported boards (like
[Arduino 101 / Genuino 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101),
[Zephyr Arduino 101](https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/board/arduino_101.html)).

### How to build

#### 1. Preface

1. Directory structure

Assume `harmony` as the path to the projects to build.
The folder tree related would look like this.

```
harmony
  + jerryscript
  |  + targets
  |      + zephyr
  + zephyr-project
```


2. Target boards/emulations

Following Zephyr boards were tested: qemu_x86, qemu_cortex_m3, arduino_101,
frdm_k64f.


#### 2. Prepare Zephyr

Follow [this](https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html) page to get
the Zephyr source and configure the environment.

If you just start with Zephyr, you may want to follow "Building a Sample
Application" section in the doc above and check that you can flash your
target board.

Remember to source the Zephyr environment as explained in the zephyr documenation:

```
cd zephyr-project
source zephyr-env.sh

export ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT=zephyr
export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=<sdk installation directory>
```

#### 3. Build JerryScript for Zephyr

The easiest way is to build and run on a QEMU emulator:

For x86 architecture:

```
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=qemu_x86 run
```

For ARM (Cortex-M) architecture:

```
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=qemu_cortex_m3 run
```

#### 4. Build for Arduino 101

```
# assume you are in harmony folder
cd jerryscript
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=arduino_101
```

This will generate the following libraries:
```
./build/arduino_101/librelease-cp_minimal.jerry-core.a
./build/arduino_101/librelease-cp_minimal.jerry-libm.lib.a
./build/arduino_101/librelease.external-cp_minimal-entry.a
```

The final Zephyr image will be located here:
```
./build/arduino_101/zephyr/zephyr.strip
```

#### 5. Flashing

Details on how to flash the image can be found here:
[Flashing image](https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/board/arduino_101.html)
(or similar page for other supported boards).

To be able to use this demo in hardware you will need the serial console
which will be generating output to Pins 0 & 1.

You will need a 3.3v TTL to RS232, please follow the zephyr documentation on it.

Some examples of building the software

```
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=<board> clean
```

- Not using a Jtag and having a factory stock Arduino 101.
You can follow the Zephyr instructions to flash using the dfu-util command
or use this helper:

```
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=arduino_101 dfu-x86
```

Make sure you have the factory bootloader in your device to use this method or it will not flash.

- Using JTAG

There is a helper function to flash using the JTAG and Flywatter2

![alt tag](docs/arduino_101.jpg?raw=true "Example")

```
make -f ./targets/zephyr/Makefile.zephyr BOARD=arduino_101 flash
```

<warning> Careful if you flash the BOARD arduino_101, you will lose the bootloader
and you will have to follow the zephyr documentation to get it back from
the backup we all know you did at the setup. </warning>

#### 6. Serial terminal

Test command line in a serial terminal.


You should see something similar to this:
```
JerryScript build: Aug 12 2016 17:12:55
JerryScript API 1.0
Zephyr version 1.4.0
js>
```


Run the example javascript command test function
```
js> var test=0; for (t=100; t<1000; t++) test+=t; print ('Hi JS World! '+test);
Hi JS World! 494550
```


Try a more complex function:
```
js> function hello(t) {t=t*10;return t}; print("result"+hello(10.5));
```
